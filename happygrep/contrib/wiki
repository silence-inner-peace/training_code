- ncurses

  you can get ncurses api doc by moving your cursor on it and K (open man page) in vim



  If you've configured your ncurses with --enable-sigwinch, then you can go the easy way out, and just watch the characters that you get from getch() for a KEY_RESIZE. When ncurses handles the SIGWINCH signal, it pushes a KEY_RESIZE back onto the queue that getch() uses, so that the next call to getch() will return that value. However, not everyone's ncurses library has been configured with that switch, so relying on that behavior is not portable.

- ncurses & Unicode

  The normal ncurses libraries support 8-bit characters. The ncurses library can also be configured (--enable-widec) to support wide-characters (for instance Unicode and the UTF-8 encoding). The corresponding wide-character ncursesw libraries are source-compatible with the normal applications. That is, applications must be compiled and linked against the ncursesw library.

  The ncurses 5.3 release provides UTF-8 support. The special cases of Linux console and screen were addressed in development patches completed at the end of 2002.
